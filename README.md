# Scheduling System
Scheduling System is a simple REST api that manages students and classes and it's able to enroll students into classes.

## Technologies
This project uses the following technologies:

* [spring-data-rest](http://projects.spring.io/spring-data-rest/) to quickly get up and running with REST api.
* [spring HATEOAS](http://projects.spring.io/spring-hateoas/) to expose the REST api following HATEOAS principle.
* [HyperSQL](http://hsqldb.org/) for in-memory database.
* [Spring REST Docs](http://docs.spring.io/spring-restdocs/docs/current/reference/html5/) for test driven generated api documentation.

## Documentation
Scheduling System docs are in this GitHub repo's [Wiki](https://github.com/maikomr/scheduling-system/wiki).
